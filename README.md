# README

IoX Plugin Developer VS Code Extension is a powerful tool that simplifies the plugin development process by taking a JSON file that describes your plugin and automatically generating all the necessary files and launch/debug profiles. It then adds your plugin to the local store and installs it on IoX. Your task is simply to complete the required details, run, debug, and then publish. All under your fingertips!

## Features

1. The JSON editor provides you with valid enumerations and values for such things as UOM, editors, etc.
2. JSON Snippets help you get started quickly: dimmer, sensor, thermostat, and modbus.
3. Automatically adds to the local store and then installs in the first avaialble slot in IoX.
3. Creates launch and debug profiles and thus from code generation to debugging takes a less than a minute.
